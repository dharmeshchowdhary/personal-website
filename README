- This is my personal website.
- It has all my projects I built for myself and community.
Some projects help you earn a little for yourelf.
It also contains my resume, my skills and my achievement.

Disclaimer: Projects where you receive rewards are not a full time job or a place to earn fixed income or hefty sums.
This is just a project where I intend to test and make myself aware of coding skills and 
how ad-agencies work while returning a part of it to the community.
